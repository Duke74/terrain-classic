# Terrain Classic

World-wide CartoCSS port of Stamen's classic terrain style.

Stamen's original Terrain style was developed as part of Stamen's
[Citytracking](https://github.com/Citytracking) initiative, funded by the
[Knight Foundation](http://www.knightfoundation.org/). The old repository can
be found [here](https://github.com/citytracking/terrain), for historical
interest.

The original Terrain style only covered the United States. As part of a 2014 Knight Foundation grant, we are expanding Terrain to cover the entire world. The new Knight Grant will also result in a totally-different new terrain style, so to avoid confusion, we are calling the old style "Terrain Classic."
